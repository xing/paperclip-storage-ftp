## Usage

Somewhere in your code:

```ruby
require "paperclip/storage/ftp"
```

In your model:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar, {
    # Choose the FTP storage backend
    :storage => :ftp,

    # Set where to store the file on the FTP server(s).
    # This supports Paperclip::Interpolations.
    :path => "/path_on_ftp_server/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",

    # The full URL of where the attachment is publicly accessible.
    # This supports Paperclip::Interpolations.
    :url => "/url_prefix/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",

    # There are multiple ways to add FTP servers.
    # 1): Pass the list of FTP servers directly.
    :ftp_servers => [
      {
        :host     => "ftp1.example.com",
        :user     => "foo",
        :password => "bar"
      },
      # Add more servers if needed
      {
        :host     => "ftp2.example.com",
        :user     => "foo",
        :password => "bar",
        :port     => 2121, # optional, 21 by default
        :passive  => true  # optional, false by default
      }
    ],

    # 2): To use credentilas dynamically from database use lamda notation.
    # ftp_credentials is class method here in which you can access
    # related association to load credentials from database.
    ftp_servers: -> (attachment) { attachment.instance.ftp_credentials }

    # Optional socket connect timeout (in seconds).
    # This only limits the connection phase, once connected
    # this option is of no more use.
    :ftp_connect_timeout => 5, # optional, nil by default (OS default timeout)

    # Optional flag to skip dead servers.
    # If set to true and the connection to a particular server cannot be
    # established, the connection error will be ignored and the files will
    # not be uploaded to that server.
    # If set to false and the connection to a particular server cannot be established,
    # a SystemCallError will be raised (Errno::ETIMEDOUT, Errno::ENETUNREACH, etc.).
    :ftp_ignore_failing_connections => true, # optional, false by default

    # Optional flag to keep empty parent directories when deleting files.
    :ftp_keep_empty_directories => true # optional, false by default
  }

  # If you are using 2nd method to add FTP Servers.
  def ftp_credentials
    [
      {
        :host     => "ftp1.example.com",
        :user     => "foo",
        :password => "bar"
      },
      # Add more servers if needed
      {
        :host     => "ftp2.example.com",
        :user     => "foo",
        :password => "bar",
        :port     => 2121, # optional, 21 by default
        :passive  => true  # optional, false by default
      }
    ]
  end
end
```
