## Usage

Somewhere in your code:

require "paperclip/storage/ftp"
```

In your model:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar,

  # Choose the FTP storage backend
  :storage => :ftp,

  # Set where to store the file on the FTP server(s).
  # This supports Paperclip::Interpolations.
  :path => "/path_on_ftp_server/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",

  # The full URL of where the attachment is publicly accessible.
  # This supports Paperclip::Interpolations.
  :url => "/url_prefix/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",

  # The list of FTP servers to use
  :ftp_servers => [
    {
      :host     => "ftp1.example.com",
      :user     => "foo",
      :password => "bar"
    },
    # Add more servers if needed
    {
      :host     => "ftp2.example.com",
      :user     => "foo",
      :password => "bar",
      :port     => 2121, # optional, 21 by default
      :passive  => true  # optional, false by default
    }
  ],

  # Optional socket connect timeout (in seconds).
  # This only limits the connection phase, once connected
  # this option is of no more use.
  :ftp_connect_timeout => 5, # optional, nil by default (OS default timeout)

  # Optional flag to skip dead servers.
  # If set to true and the connection to a particular server cannot be
  # established, the connection error will be ignored and the files will
  # not be uploaded to that server.
  # If set to false and the connection to a particular server cannot be established,
  # a SystemCallError will be raised (Errno::ETIMEDOUT, Errno::ENETUNREACH, etc.).
  :ftp_ignore_failing_connections => true # optional, false by default
end
```
